// swift-tools-version:5.9
//
// RevenueCat as a PREBUILT binary rather than a source package.
//
// Xcode 27's Swift 6.4 fails to compile purchases-ios from source: whole-
// module overload resolution rejects PaywallColor's initializers ("Invalid
// redeclaration of synthesized memberwise init", "Ambiguous use of 'init'"),
// in every 5.x release, on code we never call. It is a compiler regression,
// tracked at https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/issues/7730, and
// an older Xcode cannot be launched on the macOS that ships with 27.
//
// Every RevenueCat release attaches RevenueCat.xcframework.zip, built with
// library evolution, so its .swiftinterface files are what the app's
// compiler reads. The interface declares PaywallColor's one public init
// and nothing that could be ambiguous, so the binary links where the
// source does not. The app only imports RevenueCat (not RevenueCatUI), and
// the product name below matches what project.yml already depends on.
//
// To bump: change the version in the URL and replace the checksum with the
// SHA-256 of the new zip (`swift package compute-checksum <zip>`, or
// `shasum -a 256`). To go back to the source package once the compiler or
// the SDK is fixed: restore the `url:` package in dayglance-ios/project.yml
// and delete this directory.
