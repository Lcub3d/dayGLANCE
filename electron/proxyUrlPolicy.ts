// SSRF policy for the renderer's IPC proxy (main.ts `proxy-fetch`), extracted as
// pure decision functions in the localIntegrations.ts style: the ranges, the
// never-exemptible set, the trusted-host record shape and the allow/deny/consent
// decision all live here, tested; DNS, disk and the consent dialog live in main.ts.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A FLAT BLOCK (issue #1642)
//
// The proxy used to reject every private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT or ULA
// address outright. On a hosted relay (api/webdav-proxy.js, docker/proxy-server.mjs)
// that is correct and stays correct: those run on someone else's network and a
// flat block is the only thing standing between a stranger's URL and the
// operator's internal services.
//
// The Electron proxy is a different machine with a different threat model. It
// runs on the user's own desktop, and the whole point of a self-hosted
// GLANCEvault is that it lives on the user's own network: a LAN box on
// 192.168.x.x, a Docker host on 10.x.x.x, or a Tailscale node, whose addresses
// are CGNAT (100.64.0.0/10) and ULA (fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48) and so hit two of the
// blocked ranges at once. A flat block there does not protect the user from a
// stranger; it locks the user out of their own server on desktop ONLY, while
// Android/iOS (native HTTP bridge) and the browser build reach it fine.
//
// So the range check stays, and an address in one of those ranges is still
// refused by default. What changes is that the user can grant one specific
// host:port an exemption, through a native dialog main.ts raises from an
// explicit button press. Three properties keep that from being a hole:
//
//   1. Consent is per host:port:scheme, never per range, and never a wildcard.
//   2. Redirect targets are NEVER exempt, whatever is on the list. A public URL
//      that 302s into private space is the classic SSRF shape and the one this
//      guard exists for; a grant for the vault must not also buy a redirect hop
//      from some unrelated calendar feed. Callers pass `isRedirect: true`.
//   3. Link-local and the unspecified address are never exemptible at all
//      (see isNeverExemptibleIp). Loopback IS grantable, because a vault in
//      Docker on this same machine is a normal setup, but it is scoped to the
//      one port consented to and gets its own dialog copy.
