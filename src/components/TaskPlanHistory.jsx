// Reveals what a task was ORIGINALLY planned for, next to where it sits now.
//
// This is the first thing in the app to read `originalPlan` (utils/originalPlan.js),
// and it exists for two reasons. The obvious one is that a rescheduled task
// losing its original intention was the gap #1623 opened with. The less obvious
// one is that a field nothing reads can be silently wrong for months: the
// baseline shipped once already in a state where it never survived a sync cycle,
// and the only way to notice was a console query. This makes that check part of
// using the app.
//
// It renders NOTHING when there is no story to tell — no baseline recorded, or
// the task is still exactly where it was first put. An affordance on every task
// that opens to say "nothing happened" is worse than no affordance, and most
// tasks are in that state.
//
// The icon is lucide's `History` (a clock with a turn-back arrow) rather than
// `Clock`, which the card already uses for the task's CURRENT start time. Two
// clocks side by side meaning different things would be worse than precise.
// The panel body, exported so a test can render it directly. Everything inside
// only ever runs while the popover is open, which is precisely the code a static
// render of the closed badge cannot reach.
