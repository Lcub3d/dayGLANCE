/**
 * Today, split at the NOW line (docs/jobo-past-days.md, the addendum): the
 * ids of today's completed tasks whose plan block has given way to their Do
 * (jobo/pastDay.js, todayEndedTasks), for getDayDisplayForDate.
 *
 * Worked out from the clock on each tick, but returned as a set that keeps
 * its identity for as long as its contents do, so the views recompute only
 * when a block ends or a task is completed, never on the tick itself. While
 * `gestureActive` (a drag or a resize), the set is held as it was, so a block
 * never turns into its Do under the pointer; it catches up on the drop.
 *
 * `todayEnded` is null with no index (JOBO off, ledger not loaded), and
 * today then shows exactly as planned.
 *
 * @returns {{ todayStr: string, todayEnded: Set<string> | null }}
