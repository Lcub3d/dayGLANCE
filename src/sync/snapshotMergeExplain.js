/**
 * Compares what a snapshot-file sync cycle would write and apply against what
 * is already there, slice by slice.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * On 2026-10-05 every Mac in a fleet was seen rewriting dayglance-sync.json on
 * every cycle: each diagnostics report showed the file modified ~30 ms after
 * the cycle's read, with nothing changed on any device. Every such write made
 * the phone's copy non-current, the phone then waited minutes for the download,
 * and edits made on the phone in that window reached nobody.
 *
 * The cause was a collision of two correct rules. The iCloud write strips
 * HealthKit-derived habit counts from the file (Apple guideline 5.1.3,
 * utils/healthLogFilter.js), while the Macs hold those counts locally because
 * they arrive through GLANCEvault. So every merge saw 214 days of counts the
 * file lacked, raised `remoteChanged`, wrote a stripped file identical to the
 * one already there, and did it again next cycle. The merge's change flags
 * answer "did the merge pick anything from local?", not "would the file
 * change?", and only the second question should start a write.
 *
 * So the cycle now asks both: a write needs a flag AND a real difference
 * between the outgoing (stripped) data and the file; an apply needs a flag AND
 * a real difference between the merged data and local state. This module is
 * that comparison, and the diagnostics panel runs the identical function so
 * what it reports is what the cycle decides.
 *
 * Comparison rules: arrays of ids are matched by id with order noted
 * separately, scalar lists compare as sets, maps by entry, everything else by
 * canonical JSON. Absent and empty slices are equal, and so are absent and
 * empty entries inside a map. Slices the merge
 * re-stamps on every run (the tombstone fence) are ignored. For the apply
 * question, slices the merge output simply does not carry are ignored too:
 * applyEngineData leaves absent keys alone.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no storage, no bridge.
