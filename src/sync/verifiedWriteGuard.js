/**
 * The file tier's write gate: no upload without knowledge, and a validator on
 * every upload the engine did not read for.
 *
 * ── The hazard this closes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The engine's cycle reads, merges, then writes (with `If-Match` from the read).
 * Two other writers reached the same provider with no read at all: `App.jsx`'s
 * 5-second debounced upload on data changes, and the header/desktop sync button
 * (`engine.upload()`). Both called `engine.upload()` with no payload and no
 * ETag, so the provider PUT this device's whole snapshot with no validator —
 * after a misconfiguration the device has never read the remote, and the other
 * devices' data is gone with nothing on either side able to notice. The
 * absent-remote seed guard (`absentRemoteSeedGuard.js`) covers the 404 branch of
 * the cycle only, and its own docstring says so: a manual upload is deliberately
 * not judged by it.
 *
 * Both writers now run the full cycle (`utils/syncNowAction.js`, and the
 * debounce in `App.jsx`), so no in-app caller deliberately uploads unread. The
 * gate stays because "no in-app caller today" is not a guarantee: a bare
 * `engine.upload()` — the conflict dialog's, with the ETag it was shown, or
 * anything added later — still has to be checked, and still must not put this
 * device's snapshot on a server it has not read.
 *
 * ── The rule ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every write must be authorized by a read of the SAME target (`syncTarget.js`):
 *
 *   mode 'seed'        a read in this cycle found no remote file, and the seed
 *                      guard's timed rule allowed the seed. No validator exists
 *                      (the file is believed absent), so none is sent.
 *   mode 'cycle'       a read in this cycle found the file; the write is the
 *                      cycle's own. The read's ETag rides along — and the
 *                      validator the ENGINE passes is never overridden, so the
 *                      fallback after two 412s stays unconditional.
 *   mode 'conditional' no read in this cycle: the write is allowed only against
 *                      the ETag of the last verified read OF THIS TARGET, so a
 *                      server that has moved on refuses it (412) and the next
 *                      cycle re-reads, merges and writes. This is the last
 *                      resort for a bare upload; no ambient writer needs it.
 *   mode 'unverified'  nothing to authorize it: REFUSED. The refusal is
 *                      reported, never silent — a write that quietly did not
 *                      happen would otherwise be stamped "synced".
 *
 * A server that sends no ETag is the one honest gap: a cycle write may still go
 * out unvalidated (refusing it would stop syncing entirely), while a write with
 * no read behind it is refused. Edits still reach the server — through the next
 * full cycle, which reads first.
