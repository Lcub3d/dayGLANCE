// The language every AI prompt answers in.
//
// Every prompt in src/ai-prompts.js is written in English, so a model answers
// in English unless told otherwise, and a user with the app in Chinese got a
// Chinese Evening Reflection card with an English reflection inside it
// (#1789). The fix lives at the one choke point every request passes through,
// aiComplete, rather than in each of the eleven prompts: the system prompt is
// suffixed with an instruction naming the app's current language, so the
// briefings, the weekly summary, and the text fields inside JSON answers
// (subtask titles, reschedule reasons) all follow the setting, and a prompt
// added later is covered without remembering to.
//
// The instruction is emitted for English too. One invariant ("every prompt
// names its language") is easier to keep than a special case, and it costs a
// sentence.
