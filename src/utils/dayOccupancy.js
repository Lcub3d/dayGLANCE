// What occupies a day, in one place.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. The app grew three independent answers to "what
// is already on this date", and they disagreed:
//
//   getAdjustedTimeForImportedConflicts (App.jsx)  imported events + routines
//   computeAvailableSlots (App.jsx)                every timed task, NO routines
//   buildDayBlocks (mcpReadModel.js)               tasks + recurring + routines
//
// The middle one is a shipped bug rather than a difference of opinion: frame
// availability powers the "N min free" readout in the sidebar, day view,
// mobile list, and the schedule modal, and every one of them over-reports
// free time when a routine sits inside a frame. The drag-and-drop resolver
// on the line above has treated routines as obstacles all along, so the app
// already contradicted itself about the same fifteen minutes.
//
// WHAT IS SHARED AND WHAT IS NOT. The obstacle SET legitimately differs by
// caller, and collapsing that would be wrong:
//
//   - the drop resolver slides a task past IMMOVABLE things only. Two of your
//     own tasks may overlap on purpose; the timeline renders them in conflict
//     columns. Auto-sliding off your own task would fight the user.
//   - frame availability counts EVERY timed task, because a frame asks "how
//     much of this window is unspent", and a deliberate overlap still spends
//     it.
//
// So the caller chooses which tasks count and passes them in. What this
// module owns is everything after that choice: folding routines in, turning
// rows into intervals, merging them, and the arithmetic. Routines are not
// optional at that layer, which is the fix.
//
// PURITY. Nothing here reads the clock, localStorage, or React state. `now`
// arrives as minutes-since-midnight and the date as a string, so the same
// inputs always give the same slots. That is what makes this testable at all
// — computeAvailableSlots previously had six consumers and no unit tests.
