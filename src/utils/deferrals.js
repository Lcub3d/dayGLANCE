// How many times a task has been pushed back after it came due.
//
// WHAT IT COUNTS, AND WHY NOT EVERYTHING
// A reschedule is two different acts wearing one gesture. Laying out tomorrow
// morning by dragging four tasks around is PLANNING, and counting it would
// report on how you use the timeline rather than on anything about the work.
// Moving a task you were supposed to have started is a SLIP, and that is the
// thing worth a number: a task that keeps sliding wants breaking up, dropping,
// or scheduling honestly.
//
// So the line is not same-day versus cross-day, which cuts across the
// distinction in both directions. Moving a 09:00 task at 09:30 is a slip even
// though the day did not change; moving tomorrow's task to Friday is planning
// even though it did. The line is whether the task had already COME DUE at the
// moment you moved it.
//
// MONOTONIC ON PURPOSE
// The count only ever rises, which is what lets two devices merge it by taking
// the maximum. Summing would double-count the same slip observed twice; a
// carry-forward would lose a count made offline. Max is the best estimate either
// device can offer and needs no coordination. That property is worth protecting:
// anything that could lower the number breaks the merge.

// "HH:MM" to minutes. Parsed here rather than imported: the only exported copy
// lives in streamDeckPayload.js, which pulls in the Electron protocol, and a
// core scheduling rule should not depend on the Stream Deck.
