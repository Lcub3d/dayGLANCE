// The late-observation gate for daily notes (owner ruling, 2026-09-09,
// buildout spec 2.7: "newest mtime wins for text").
//
// A daily note's observations reach the app two ways: this device's own scan
// of the file, and the plugin's reports over the bridge stream. Either can
// arrive late: a stream row applied after a newer one, a second desktop's
// plugin reporting its lagging Obsidian Sync copy, or this device's own copy
// lagging behind an observation it already applied. The 2026-09-08 incident
// was a lagging copy; the same day's console showed a note's stamp move
// backwards at startup from a late row.
//
// The rule extends the existing one that a note's mtime is the vault's
// statement time (revival, §3.10 ruling 6) to the note's TEXT: an observation
// whose real mtime is strictly older than the mtime of the last observation
// this device applied for that date is stale evidence and is dropped, text
// and mtime both. Equal or newer applies as before. Memory is device-local
// (never synced): a storage purge resets it and the next observation applies.
// An observation with no real mtime carries no evidence either way and always
// applies, exactly as it always did.
//
// Known edge, accepted in the ruling: a note put back to an older version by
// a tool that preserves the old mtime is not seen until its next edit.
// Obsidian's own writes and restores set a fresh mtime.
//
// SCOPED NOTES AND PARSED TASKS (2026-09-17, after #1692's assessment). The
// gate judged daily notes only, and only their text: the tasks parsed from
// a stale report still merged, and a scoped note (a linked project note, a
// note in the vault task scope) was never judged at all. A second plugin
// copy reporting its lagging Obsidian Sync copy of a project note could
// then revert a dayGLANCE retitle for a round, or for good if that copy's
// last report was the stale one. Now every observed note is judged, keyed
// by date (daily) or path (scoped), and the tasks parsed from a skipped
// note are dropped with its text. The signal is the file's own mtime as the
// plugin reports it: Obsidian Sync carries a file's mtime with it, so a
// lagging copy reports the OLD version's mtime, not the time it arrived;
// the one exception the plugin makes (a note that arrived at a path by
// create or move reports its arrival time) is deliberate revival evidence.
// Path keys never parse as dates, so their memory entries are pruned by the
// age of the stored mtime instead.
