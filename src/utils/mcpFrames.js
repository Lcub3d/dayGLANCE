// Frames on the MCP read surface (docs/mcp-server-spec.md §5.1).
//
// A frame is not a block. Blocks are things ON the day; a frame is a WINDOW
// the user set aside, and its point is the part that is still empty. So it
// rides alongside `blocks` rather than inside it, and carries its free slots
// rather than making the caller subtract one list from the other and get the
// buffer arithmetic wrong.
//
// FRAMES ARE RULE-BASED, unlike routines. A routine exists for exactly one
// date and is wiped at rollover; a frame is a template with a day-of-week
// rule, so it resolves for any date, past or future. There is no date guard
// here and nothing analogous to one is needed.
//
// TAG AFFINITY IS REPORTED, NOT APPLIED. The frame's affinity tags go out as
// data and the model matches tasks against the inbox itself. A
// suggest_tasks_for_frame tool was the alternative and would have been worse:
// it bakes one ranking rule into the wire protocol, and picking which of your
// open tasks suits a two-hour deep-work window is the thing a model is
// actually good at. filterFrameScheduleTasks stays the app's own rule for the
// app's own modal.
//
// READ-ONLY. There are no frame write tools. Frames are created and edited in
// the Frames modal, whose shape is nothing like a task mutation, so every
// frame reported here carries read_only: true, the same flag device calendar
// events and routines carry.
