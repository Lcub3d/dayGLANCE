// The month view's headline numbers, with the All-Time Summary's
// definitions (hooks/useStats.js) narrowed to one calendar month:
//
//  • scheduled: the user's non-imported tasks dated in the month, recurring
//    occurrences that fall in it, and inbox tasks whose deadline falls in it;
//  • completed: those of them that are done; incomplete: the rest;
//  • percent: completed out of scheduled, null when nothing was scheduled;
//  • plannedMinutes / spentMinutes: the durations of the scheduled items and
//    of the completed ones, so "spent" compares like with like against
//    "planned" (an inbox task done without a deadline has no plan to compare
//    to and counts under inboxDone instead);
//  • inboxDone: plain inbox tasks (no deadline, no project) completed in the
//    span, by their completion stamp, the summary's "Inbox done";
//  • focusMinutes: focus-mode minutes logged on the counted tasks.
//
// Like the summary, only days up to and including today count: a task set
// for next week is not "incomplete" yet. So a past month is fully counted,
// the current month is counted through today, and a future month has
// nothing to report (`counted` is false) and the header shows nothing.
