// Referential integrity for deletions (#2137).
//
// dayGLANCE keeps its collections independent and syncs each one on its own:
// tasks point at a project with `projectId`, projects point at a goal with
// `goalId`, and members are referenced by `assignedUserSyncIds` / `ownerSyncId`.
// A deletion is a tombstone on the deleted entity and nothing else walks the
// surviving rows. A reference that outlives its target is INVISIBLE state: the
// Inbox treats "has a projectId" as "belongs to a project" and hides the task
// (useComputedViews.filteredUnscheduledTasks), while the goal dashboard can
// only show a project under its own goal or as standalone, so a project whose
// goal is gone belongs to neither list. The task/project is then reachable only
// from surfaces that do not look the reference up at all, e.g. the overdue
// list — which reads as "it was deleted, why is it still there?".
//
// The delete-time cascades (utils/deleteCascade.js) clean up new deletions; the
// same helpers repair rows written before they existed and rows a peer had not
// repaired yet, at the two ingress points (loadData, applyEngineData).
//
// THE ONE RULE: a reference is dangling because a TOMBSTONE says its target is
// deleted, never because the id is missing from a list this device holds. A
// list can be incomplete for reasons that have nothing to do with deletion: a
// vault pull that carried tasks but not projects, a fresh device whose projects
// key is still [], a payload from a client with Goals & Projects off. Treating
// absence as deletion would detach live rows — and the repair would then win
// last-writer-wins on every other device. This is the same line the Todoist
// integration holds ("a missing source record means no information, never
// deletion").
//
// The helpers are pure and return the SAME array identity when nothing changed,
// so callers can feed them through React setters without causing a re-render
// (and a needless lastModified re-stamp) on every sync cycle.
