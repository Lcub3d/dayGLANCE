// After a sync merge is applied to React state, re-add device-local tasks that
// the merge never governed — native OS tasks, imported calendar items, external-
// intent tasks, and Obsidian-derived tasks — which buildSyncPayload excludes from
// the payload (or which were added locally in the race window between payload-
// build and apply), so the merged result legitimately doesn't contain them and a
// plain replace would drop them.
//
// THE TOMBSTONE GUARD (the fix): a task that IS synced but carries one of those
// flags (e.g. old seed data with `imported: true`) sits in a gap — buildSyncPayload
// pushes it, so a delete on another device propagates here as an absence from the
// merged set, yet the flag-based rescue re-adds it every cycle. buildSyncPayload
// then re-pushes it and the peer re-deletes it: the seed-task resurrection
// ping-pong. The rescue therefore MUST skip any id the merge has tombstoned
// (`deletedIds`, the merged post-pull deletedTaskIds set) — those were deleted
// elsewhere and must stay deleted. An untombstoned flagged task is still a genuine
// race-add and is preserved.
//
// OBSIDIAN TASKS (the ala7ur fix): an Obsidian task (`importSource: 'obsidian'`)
// is re-derived from the local vault every scan, so it is device-owned in the same
// sense as a native/imported task — but it is ALSO a synced vault row, so the two
// subsystems race. Symptom: the Obsidian scan adds the task to state, then the very
// next DB-sync apply commits a merged set that (transiently) lacks it and — because
// it was not rescuable — drops it; the next scan re-adds it; repeat. That is the
// observed appear/vanish flicker of a note-backed task (e.g. an inline-dated task
// living in a differently-dated daily note). Making Obsidian tasks rescuable keeps
// a live, note-backed task stable across a merge apply that omits it. A GENUINELY
// vault-deleted task still stays gone: it is tombstoned in `deletedObsidianKeys`
// (the Obsidian deletion map, last-writer-wins via isObsidianTombstoned), so the
// rescue leaves it deleted — no resurrection. Deleting it in the dayGLANCE UI
// (which writes `deletedTaskIds`) is likewise honored by the shared guard below.
//
// THE CROSS-LIST GUARD (2026-09-05, the phone-soak duplicate): a cross-list move
// leaves no tombstone — scheduling an inbox task moves its id from
// unscheduledTasks to tasks, and the DB tier's reconcile keeps exactly one copy
// per id. This rescue runs PER LIST and saw only its own list: a peer's move
// arrived as "the id is gone from the inbox result", the rescue found the old
// inbox copy in prev, rescuable and untombstoned, and put it back — undoing the
// reconcile's choice every cycle. The next diff saw it as new, the push
// soft-deleted its row, the reconcile dropped it again, the rescue re-added it:
// a delete/resupply loop that the war guard eventually froze as a visible
// duplicate (a task on the timeline AND in the inbox). The rescue therefore
// takes the ids LIVE ANYWHERE in the incoming result (both lists and the
// recycle bin — the same set the retirement pass uses) and never rescues one:
// an id the merge placed somewhere is governed by the merge, and its absence
// from THIS list is a move, not a loss.
//
// THE HORIZON GUARD (2026-10-06, the Android ghost): a tombstone only lives 60
// days (src/sync/tombstoneRetention.js). A device offline longer than that still
// holds the task in `prev`, its tombstone has been GC'd, and the merge drops the
// task by its own fence (a local-only task older than the remote's
// `tombstonePrunedBefore` is presumed deleted elsewhere, not uploaded). The
// tombstone guard above cannot fire, so the rescue re-added it, the next cycle's
// merge dropped it again, and the apply ran every 15 s forever: a phone that had
// not synced since June held one inbox task the rest of the fleet had deleted
// months before, and the diagnostics showed "would apply: YES" on every check.
// This used to be documented here as a known boundary. It is closed by giving
// the rescue the same fence the merge uses: a prev-only task the merge GOVERNS
// (one buildSyncPayload would have sent: not native, and not an import the
// payload excludes) whose lastModified is older than `horizon` is not rescued.
// Device-only tasks the payload never carries (native rows, excluded imports)
// are re-provided by their own source and are not subject to it; nor is
// anything when the caller has no horizon to offer.
