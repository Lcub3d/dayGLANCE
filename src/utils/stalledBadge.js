/**
 * Whether a project SHOWS the Stalled badge — the one gate every surface in
 * the Goals & Projects space uses (project card, project sidebar row, and the
 * goal card / goal row / phone goal header through hasStalledChild), so a
 * goal's caution and its child's badge never disagree.
 *
 * On top of the shared rule (isProjectStalled: 7+ days old, an open task, no
 * completion in 7 days) a project is flagged only when:
 *   - it belongs to a goal — standalone projects are never flagged; there is
 *     no per-project opt-out, and momentum on them is the Weekly Review's job
 *   - that goal has not opted out (hideStalled)
 *   - it has no active hyperGLANCE session (a session IS the plan)
 *   - it is not completed
