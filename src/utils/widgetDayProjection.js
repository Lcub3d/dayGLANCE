// Day-keyed widget snapshot: the next N days, projected in advance so a
// widget can switch days at midnight without the app running.
//
// WHY: only the WebView writes widget content. A phone left in the background
// across midnight used to wake up with every widget holding yesterday's
// agenda; the stale state that landed first (WidgetFreshness.swift / .kt)
// made that honest, not fresh. This module makes it fresh for the DAY: the
// snapshot effect in App.jsx builds today exactly as before and adds
// `days: [today+1 … today+N]`, each built from the same functions, keyed by
// date. The native side resolves the entry's local day against the payload
// (docs/widget-background-refresh-plan.md, options iOS-A / Android-A).
//
// WHAT A PROJECTED DAY IS: right about the SHAPE of the day (timed blocks,
// all-day items, deadlines, frames, goals due, the sky, the dial) and silent
// about STATE that cannot exist yet — the day's completions, its habit
// counts, its routines (chips the user places each day; a new day starts
// empty, so a projected dial honestly has fewer blocks than the day will
// eventually have), the overdue list (which is today's, repeated), the
// GLANCEahead preview, hyperGLANCE sessions and the Live Activity summary
// (all today-only by construction). The native side labels a projected day
// "planned as of <push time>".
//
// WHAT IS KEPT ON PURPOSE: per-task tags and project references, at the same
// richness as the pushed day. The dial's Phase 4 timeline is 96 entries over
// 24 hours, so a timeline built at 20:00 draws tomorrow after midnight, with
// tomorrow's needle moving through tomorrow's blocks and the hub naming each
// block and its tag as it becomes current.
//
// N = 3: a weekend away stays covered, and the dial's own 24-hour timeline
// crosses midnight by design, so N = 1 would break the dial's timeline and
// not just the multi-day case. Recurring instances for those days exist only
// because the expansion range is anchored at today+N as well as today
// (recurringExpansionRange.js) — without that anchor a user parked on last
// week would get projected days with recurring blocks silently missing.
