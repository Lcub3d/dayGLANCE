// Device-calendar events for the widget snapshot, independent of what the app
// is showing.
//
// WHY: device events (EventKit / CalendarContract) are never stored; App.jsx
// fetches them live for the span on screen (utils/nativeFetchWindow.js) and
// each fetch replaces the last. The snapshot read the same list, so the month
// grid only had device events for the days last viewed — ±2 days around the
// selection on DAY. The widget needs the whole window whatever is on screen,
// so it gets its own fetch (hooks/useWidgetNativeEvents.js) over exactly the
// days the window reads (widgetMonthWindow.js monthWindowFetchDates), and this
// module swaps those events in when the snapshot is built.

/**
 * The fetch, grouped by day: { dates: Set<'YYYY-MM-DD'>, byDate: {date: task[]} }.
 * `dates` is every day fetched, including days with no events — an empty day
 * in the fetch is information ("nothing on this day"), not a gap.
